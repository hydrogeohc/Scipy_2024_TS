## Evaluation Methodology

### Dataset Characteristics:
- **Total samples**: 1000 days
- **Training set**: 970 days (97%)
- **Test set**: 30 days (3%)
- **Components**: Trend + Seasonality + Noise
- **Frequency**: Daily observations

### Train/Test Split Strategy:
- Used temporal split (chronological)
- No data leakage from future to past
- Test set represents recent period
- Representative of production scenario

### Why These Metrics?

**1. MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- Easy to interpret: average error in original units (kWh)
- Less sensitive to outliers than RMSE
- Directly represents typical prediction error
- Used for primary model ranking

**2. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- Penalizes large errors more heavily
- More sensitive to outliers
- Useful when large errors are particularly costly
- Complements MAE for complete picture

**3. Runtime**
- Critical for production deployment
- Includes training time only (not inference)
- Measured on consistent hardware
- Important for model iteration speed

### Reproducibility:
- Random seed: 42 (where applicable)
- Same hardware for all experiments
- Same train/test split
- Consistent evaluation framework
